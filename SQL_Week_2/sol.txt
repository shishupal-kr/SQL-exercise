Sure, I'll provide solutions for the SQL questions listed in the `SQL_Week_2/2_solution.sql` file.

### A. Pizza Metrics

1. **How many pizzas were ordered?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders;
```

2. **How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_customer_orders
FROM customer_orders;
```

3. **How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**
```sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation = ''
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

4. **How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```sql
SELECT pn.pizza_name, COUNT(co.order_id) AS total_delivered
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name;
```

5. **How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```sql
SELECT co.customer_id, pn.pizza_name, COUNT(co.order_id) AS total_ordered
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
WHERE pn.pizza_name IN ('Vegetarian', 'Meatlovers')
GROUP BY co.customer_id, pn.pizza_name;
```

6. **What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```sql
SELECT MAX(pizza_count) AS max_pizzas_in_order
FROM (
    SELECT order_id, COUNT(pizza_id) AS pizza_count
    FROM customer_orders
    GROUP BY order_id
) AS subquery;
```

7. **For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```sql
SELECT co.customer_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL OR co.extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pizzas_with_changes,
       SUM(CASE WHEN co.exclusions IS NULL AND co.extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pizzas_without_changes
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY co.customer_id;
```

8. **How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(co.order_id) AS pizzas_with_exclusions_and_extras
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE co.exclusions IS NOT NULL AND co.extras IS NOT NULL
  AND (ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = '');
```

9. **What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?**
```sql
SELECT HOUR(order_time) AS order_hour, COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY HOUR(order_time);
```

10. **What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**
```sql
SELECT DAYNAME(order_time) AS order_day, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY DAYNAME(order_time);
```

These queries should help you answer the questions related to pizza metrics.
